#Forking the Web

####ForkingTheWeb/1

imagine sitting in a room  
with one hundred women  
weaving the internet &  
unweaving its alien mask  
 
would the web hold us  
differently could the web  
bring us warmth not    
yet imagined    




####ForkingTheWeb/2

these are poems for opening the web  
these are poems for helping the user take control  
the web it pushes and pins  
their love into something else’s stomach  

these are poems for all of the users  
the smallest of users the quietest   
and most ignorant of users  
whose use is used to grow the   
mighty screen which  
coats the world  
and divvies our eyes  
from meeting  

these are poems for beginners  
they will not try at beauty  
they are hardly even poems  
just warm and urgent invitations  
to take part of what is closed in  
darkness needing the   
tilling of every last user  

to fruit its joy   
is everyone’s  



####ForkingTheWeb/3  

the expert and the novice must sit down  
and learn how to be very close  
deeply caring for one another  
as their true fate  

####ForkingTheWeb/4
forking is   
when you take  
how someone made
the world and 
modify it for 
your own   
purpose  

it is a liberty  
that expresses  
the fact that   
human beings  
can neither  
fully anticipate nor  
dictate  
the needs of  
others   

those who  
would are
tyrants depriving  
even themselves  
from whom  
they know not  
yet they  
are  





####ForkingTheWeb/5

what is the web? you know this already  
but on a test or in front of the expert?  
tell us, what is the web. do not stutter  
be confident for your experience is truth   
even if you do not have the technical language even if  
it makes you ramble or say nothing at all. if you have  
felt the web as a heartthrob or madness then  
this the expert must learn. wideness and narrowness   
must tickle each other. and you must  
be changed by the way you change the  
expert. neither poems nor facts are   
anything, but the world   
coming into being    

what is the web? it is our togetherness. it is  
what we make eye contact with regardless. it is  
fraught with hostile design. with our many eyes  
and many hands and many hearts we must weed,   
and we must imagine, and learn anew  
how we want to touch
